This seminar was cancelled due to illness. The most important aspects were covered in week 3.

Original plan:
> We'll recap the most important points related to postings, posting lists and how we can efficiently merge these. We will introduce assignment A. In accordance with the seminar-wishes from last week there will be (a lot of) time for 1-1 assignment aid.
